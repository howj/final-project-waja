- Will Hwang

We created a shiny app, which can be found [here](https://howj.shinyapps.io/finalprojwaja/), using data from the WHO about malaria cases/deaths per country. In our app, 
we aim to answer some questions about malaria.

Using our data viz, the following questions are answered:

1. In what region is Malaria most widespread?
2. Which countries have the highest rate of cases/deaths per 1000 people?
3. What has the general trend of malaria deaths/cases been per country since 2000?
4. What characteristics do countries with a high malaria risk share?
